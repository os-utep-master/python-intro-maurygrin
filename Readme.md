Intro to Python Lab: Word Counter
===================================
Author: Mauricio Roberto Hidalgo

This program writes into an output file how many times a word was written in an input file in alphabetical order. 

Instructions for the project:

    - Write the name of an input file and an output file as an input once you are on the main directory.
	- Example: $ python wordCount.py input.txt output.txt 
	- input.txt is the file to be used as an input and output.txt is going to be the file that is going to contain the counting.
	- The program is going to tell you did not put the correct number of arguments or 	if the input file does not exist.
